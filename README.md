# SC4 Time Of Day Menu

Right click the **God Mode** button in SimCity 4: a small Maxis-style menu
opens next to it with the 24 hours in two columns (00:00–11:00 | 12:00–23:00).
Click an hour to set the city's time of day. The plugin issues the game's own
cheat, exactly as Ctrl+X `whattimeizit <hour>` does.

The menu closes after a pick, on a left click outside it, or on any right click.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Install only one of the two.** SC4 Time Of Day Menu has a big brother,
> [SC4 Time Control](https://github.com/Spamoidutout/SC4TimeControl).
> Both use the right-click on the God Mode button, so they must **not** be
> installed together.
> - **SC4 Time Of Day Menu** (this one) is the lightweight version: just a menu
>   to change the hour.
> - **SC4 Time Control** is the complete version: the same menu, plus the clock
>   next to the date, the speed of the day/night cycle (Pause, 1/2 to x8) and
>   settings.
>
> If SC4 Time Control is in your Plugins folder, delete `SC4TimeControl.dll`,
> `SC4TimeControl.dat` and `SC4TimeControl.ini` before installing SC4 Time Of Day Menu.

## Install

Download `SC4TimeOfDayMenu-1.0.zip` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/Spamoidutout/SC4TimeOfDayMenu/releases) page and copy
`SC4TimeOfDayMenu.dll` and `SC4TimeOfDayMenu.dat` into the root of
`Documents\SimCity 4\Plugins`. Requires SimCity 4 1.1.641 for Windows.

## How it works

- Subscribes once, in `PostAppInit`, to the mouse message `0xFA0C6390`.
- On a right button release over the God Mode button (window `0x2988BC85`,
  found with `GetChildWindowFromIDRecursive`, visible), notes the request.
- In the `OnIdle` of a system service: opens the menu from the UI script
  `{0x00000000, 0xB99FCED4, 0x1}`, fills its texts; on a pick, closes it and
  calls `DoesCheatCodeMatch("whattimeizit")` then
  `SendCheatNotifications("whattimeizit <hour>", id)` on the cheat code manager.
- The menu only opens with a city loaded and closes if the city goes away.

## Build

```
sh build/build.sh
```

clang + lld-link, 32-bit, no CRT (`/nodefaultlib /noentry`), no imports; the
`.dat` is rebuilt by `tools/build_dat.py` (Python 3 + Pillow).

With Visual Studio: Win32 (x86) DLL, C++20, include dirs `sdk/include`,
`sdk/shim`, `src`, source `src/TimeOfDayMenu.cpp`. Add `src/NoCrt.cpp` only
for a build without the CRT (`/NODEFAULTLIB /NOENTRY /GS-`).

The `.dat` ids are in both `tools/build_dat.py` and `src/TimeOfDayMenu.cpp`.
